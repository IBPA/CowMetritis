* **Dairy**: Name of the farm
* **ID**: Number/identification of the animal
* **DIMd0**: Days in milk at the enrolment (When metritis was diagnosed, and the animal was assigned to receive or not the antibiotic). Day in milk start when a cow has a parturition and initiates a lactation. Metritis generally will occur within the first two post parturition.
* **TRT**: Treatment
	* CEF: Antibiotic group
	* CON: Non treated group
* **D0month**: Month of the metritis diagnosis
* **Season**: Season of the metritis diagnosis
	* cool: Metritis was diagnosed between September and May
	* hot: Metritis was diagnosed between June and August
* **Lact**: Number of birth followed by lactation that the each cow had
* **Parity**: Number of birth (Categoric data)
	* P: primiparous, one birth
	* M: multiparous, more than one birth
* **CalvDif**: How hard was the birth (calving) event
	1. **Score 1**: Unassisted
	2. **Score 2**: Easy Pull / Slight Problem. One person (can be using chains and handles) but without the use of ropes / pulley.
	2. **Score 3**: Difficult Pull / Two people pulling or one person plus moderate use of ropes / pulley
	2. **Score 4**: Very Difficult Pull / Large amount of force needed. Ropes / pulley essential for delivery of calf
	2. **Score 5**: C-section or fetotomy
* **CalfInfo**: Gender of the calf
	* M: Male
	* F: Female
	* T: Twins
	* S: Stillbirth
* **RFM**: Retained fetal membranes – if the cow failure to expel fetal membranes within 12 hours after parturition. ("Yes" or "No", "1 or 0")
* **BCS5**: Body condition score. Visual evaluation of body fat reserves using a 5-point scale with 0.25-point increments where 1=very thin 5=very fat.
* **BCS5C**: BCS at 5 DIM (categoric data) (Low, moderate, or high)
* **VLS**: Vaginal laceration due to birth (calving) (0= "no", 1="Yes" and < 2 cm, 2="Yes" > 2 cm)
* **VLSC**: Vaginal laceration due to birth (calving) (categoric data), (0 = No VLS or < 2 cm, 1= VLS > 2 cm)
* **Fevd0**: If the animal was or not febrile at the metritis diagnose day ("Yes" or "No", "1 or 0")
* **Tempd0**: Rectal temperature (°C) measured on the day of metritis diagnosis
* **Cured**: If the animal cured up to 12 days after enrolment
* **Daystocure**: Days from enrolment (metritis diagnosis) to cure
* **DIMcure**: Days in milk for cure (Days from the calving to the day that the cure was diagnosed)
* **Milkincrease5DIM**: Slope of the increase in milk production in the first 05 days of lactation
* **Milkincrease7DIM**: Slope of the increase in milk production in the first 07 days of lactation
* **Milkincrease9DIM**: Slope of the increase in milk production in the first 09 days of lactation
